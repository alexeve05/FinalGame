Apr 25 2024 cs120 lab, final game project

  A summary of the project goals:
The game concept is the user is a little red car on an open track, using the arrow keys to collect as many coins as possible in the time given, 30 seconds.

  Instructions the player may need:
Use the arrow keys to control the car. The play and quit button can be used when clicked with mouse or mousepad. 

  A list of technologies and techniques you used:
I imported pygame, simpleGE, and a randomizer. I used sprites, class functions, buttons, labels, timers, etc. to create my game.

  Citations for any external resources you used:
All documented in FinalGame folder, cs120 final game project pdf.

  A description of your process: 
I looked through previous lab projects to see what i knew, and created a game idea from the basic ideas, like moving sprites and randomizing. I rough drafted my idea and possible functions i could add to make it my own. I found simple images and started working code in function by function. From an instruction scence as the game to a fully functioning game with a timer and scores.

  What did you learn?: 
I learned that breaking each part into function can make things way easier, and it doesnt need to work perfectly the first time. Also dont be afraid to delete something completely and start over.

  Where did you get stuck?:
I did get stuck with an idea at first, and how to make it my own. But once i figured that own, I got stuck on how to make the coin appear on different parts of the screen without moving like the last project.

  What would you like to improve?:
I wish i couldve added a border or boundary to the edges of the gameplay screen. 

  How would you do things differently next time?:
I think next time, for a project as big as this, I will organize my documentation better for my to read and follow along.

  How far did you stray from the game design document?:
Very far. The first draft of my game was just a car driving freely on a track map with no time limit for the user. It was mainly so I could play around with car physics and motion, but even I got bored of the game. 

  How did you stay on track?:
I would constantly remind myself that the game itself does not have to be extravagant or flashy, as long as I knew what I was doing in the code and it worked, thats all that mattered to me. If I attempted to add something new and it didnt work or I didnt fully understand what I was doing, I wouldnt include it.
